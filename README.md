# 🏛️ Cathedral

> Teaching machines to understand algorithms as thoughts, not just code to execute.

## What is Cathedral?

Cathedral is a hybrid neural-symbolic system for algorithmic understanding. 
It combines formal verification (Haskell) with neural learning (Python) to 
create a system that can represent, reason about, and explain algorithms.

**Core capabilities:**
- Formal algorithm representation
- Correctness verification
- Similarity recognition  
- Natural language explanation
- Algorithm generation

## Architecture

- **Haskell Core**: Symbolic reasoning, formal verification
- **Python Neural**: Pattern recognition, embeddings, GNNs
- **Knowledge Base**: PostgreSQL graph database
- **Interface**: SwiftUI/Web

## Status

🏗️ **In Development** - Week 1/15

Started: October 2025

## Quick Start

[Coming soon]

## Documentation

Soon theoretical/research paper

## Philosophy

> "Computation is not execution — it is reasoning incarnate."

Cathedral treats algorithms as living architectures of logic, 
building a system where proof and perception coalesce.

From first principles, with love.
